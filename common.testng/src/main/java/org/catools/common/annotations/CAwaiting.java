/**
 * The {@code CAwaiting} annotation is used to mark test methods that are currently failing
 * and awaiting action from someone or need investigation. This annotation helps identify
 * tests that require attention but are not necessarily due to known defects.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is particularly useful for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Tests that fail intermittently and need investigation</li>
 *   <li>Tests waiting for external resources or environment setup</li>
 *   <li>Tests that fail due to unclear requirements or specifications</li>
 *   <li>Tests that need refactoring or redesign</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Guidelines:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Use the {@code CORE_SKIP_CLASS_WITH_AWAITING_TEST} flag to avoid running tests 
 *       with {@code CAwaiting} annotation in CI/CD pipelines</li>
 *   <li>If test fails due to a known defect, use {@link COpenDefects} annotation instead</li>
 *   <li>When a defect is fixed, replace {@link COpenDefects} with {@link CDefects} to maintain
 *       visibility on all related defects for faster root cause identification</li>
 *   <li>Always provide a clear and descriptive cause in the {@code cause()} parameter</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Example 1: Test waiting for environment setup
 * @Test
 * @CAwaiting(cause = "Test database not configured in staging environment")
 * public void testUserRegistration() {
 *     // Test implementation that depends on database
 * }
 *
 * // Example 2: Intermittent failure requiring investigation
 * @Test
 * @CAwaiting(cause = "Intermittent timeout - needs investigation of network latency")
 * public void testApiResponseTime() {
 *     // Test that occasionally fails due to timing issues
 * }
 *
 * // Example 3: Unclear requirements
 * @Test
 * @CAwaiting(cause = "Business rules for edge case validation not defined")
 * public void testEdgeCaseValidation() {
 *     // Test waiting for clarification on business requirements
 * }
 *
 * // Example 4: External dependency issue
 * @Test
 * @CAwaiting(cause = "Third-party service API changes - awaiting documentation update")
 * public void testExternalServiceIntegration() {
 *     // Test affected by external API changes
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Migration Path:</strong>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // When issue is identified as a defect:
 * @Test
 * @COpenDefects(defects = {"DEF-12345"})
 * public void testSomeFeature() { ... }
 *
 * // After defect is fixed:
 * @Test
 * @CDefects(defects = {"DEF-12345"})
 * public void testSomeFeature() { ... }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @since 1.0
 * @see CDeferred for tests that are deferred to future releases
 * @see CIgnored for tests that are intentionally ignored
 * @see CDefects for tests related to resolved defects
 * @see COpenDefects for tests related to open defects

public @interface CAwaiting {
  /**
   * Specifies the reason why the test is awaiting action or investigation.
   * This should provide clear and actionable information about what needs to be done
   * or what issue needs to be resolved.
   *
   * <p>The cause should be descriptive enough for other team members to understand
   * the context and take appropriate action without additional investigation.
   *
   * <p><strong>Good Examples:</strong>
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code "Database migration script missing for test data setup"}</li>
   *   <li>{@code "API endpoint returns 500 error - server logs show connection timeout"}</li>
   *   <li>{@code "Business requirements unclear for multi-currency calculations"}</li>
   *   <li>{@code "External mock service not available in test environment"}</li>
   *   <li>{@code "Performance threshold needs to be defined by product team"}</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><strong>Avoid Vague Descriptions:</strong>
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code "Broken"} - Too vague, doesn't explain what's broken</li>
   *   <li>{@code "Fails sometimes"} - Doesn't provide actionable information</li>
   *   <li>{@code "TODO"} - Doesn't explain what needs to be done</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * @return a descriptive string explaining why the test is awaiting action
   *
   * @example
   * <pre>{@code
   * @CAwaiting(cause = "Login API returns inconsistent response format - needs backend team review")
